## VS Code Extension

SpecView is also available as a **VS Code extension** with additional features beyond the web version.

### Install

**From VS Code Marketplace** (recommended):

Search "SpecView" in the Extensions panel, or install directly:

```
ext install sunxingwei.specview
```

Or visit: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sunxingwei.specview

**From VSIX (local install):**

cd specview-vscode
npm install && node esbuild.mjs
npx @vscode/vsce package
code --install-extension specview-0.1.2.vsix
```

### Additional Extension Features

Beyond all web version features, the VS Code extension adds:

- **Custom editor** — double-click audio files to open directly in SpecView
- **Explorer integration** — right-click files → "Open with SpecView"; right-click folder → "Open folder with SpecView"
- **Folder loading** — loads all top-level audio files sorted by filename (natural sort)
- **ONNX model disk caching** — model downloaded once, cached across sessions
- **Same-name different-directory grouping** — files with same name from different dirs auto-grouped with parent folder name as tag
- **File deduplication** — already loaded files silently skipped; removed files can be re-added
